### WTF is a bookmarklet?

Bookmarklets are like add-ons and extensions to your web browser, except they live on your bookmark as a *bookmarked page* and does something cool when you click on them. Essentially they are code that lives in the URL of your bookmark, like gfycaffeine!


### Can we call it something else?

I wish. How bout starscripts?


### So what does this ~~starscript~~ bookmarklet do?

Javascript to replace newly generated links to download links in .mp4 during upload.


### How do I start using it?

1. Copy the code in gfycaffeine.js.

2. Add a page to your bookmarks.

3. On the URL field, paste the code.

4. Name page Gfycaffeine, or something cool.


### Okay, now what?

Clicking on it the first time will take you to the upload page of gfycat. If you are already there, nothing will happen- cos' d'oh, you're already there!

Gfycaffeine only works when you're uploading multiple medias. If you're only uploading one, pull up your socks and get your .mp4s the traditional way.

Once your medias have been uploaded, click on **Gfycaffine** again and it will convert the generated links (that go to a viewing page) to direct .mp4 that you can right click and save, or whatever.


### What if I want .webm?

Look in the code, change ".mp4" to ".webm".


### What if I want .gif?

Look in the code, change ".mp4" to ".gif".
